			<p>This is my pet cat, Stitch. Although she is my family's cat not just mine. We got her just a few weeks after we got our first cat, Lilo. Yes, my sister's got to name them after Lilo & Stich. I personally was hoping to name her Bugaboo. Stitch is very kind (except when she is scratching at my toes) and often follows me around my house. She actually makes it kind of hard to move sometimes because she runs up and sits on my feet. Stitch can be a little annoying, but I'm glad she is around.</p>
